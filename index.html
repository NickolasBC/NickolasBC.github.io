        <p>I'm a front-end web developer & UX designer from Los Angeles, CA. I'm 28 years old and I went to school at the University of California, Irvine and 
        studied Computer Science with emphasis on bioinformatics. I enjoy problem solving and logic, as well as cryptography and discrete algebra, and playing with my two kittens.</p>

        <p>
            I worked at Belkin on their smart home UX design team for four years. I wrked mostly with smart thermostats which as you can imagine is quite tedious after four years.

        <p>
            I was a paid intern at Microsoft working on their encryption mechanisms for their Xbox console during the pre-launch of the new X console. It was hardly any work but was a cool experience. We dumped the container keys that were responsible for the encyption using a linux-based kernal exploit that was introduced in 2006.

        <p>
            I completed my bachelors of science at UCI in computer science, I transferred from LBCC and El Camino as my JC's. I did particularly well in the comp. science classes but struggled with a lot of the calculus and english based courses. Computer Architecture was my favorite course.
